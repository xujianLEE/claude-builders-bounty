# Claude Builders Bounty 🤖

> A community bounty board for Claude Code builders.

## Generate a changelog

This repository includes a small Bash tool for generating a structured
`CHANGELOG.md` from git history.

1. Run `bash changelog.sh` or `python generate_changelog.py` from any git repository.
2. Review the generated `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Commit the changelog when it looks right.

The script finds the latest git tag and reads commits after that tag. If the
repository has no tags, it uses the full commit history. Commits are grouped
into `Added`, `Fixed`, `Changed`, and `Removed` using common Conventional Commit
prefixes and simple keyword matching.

Example output:

```md
# Changelog

## 2026-05-13

Generated for `example-project` since v1.2.0.

### Added

- feat: add export command (`abc1234`)

### Fixed

- fix: handle missing config file (`def5678`)

### Changed

- docs: update setup guide (`999aaaa`)

### Removed

_No entries._
